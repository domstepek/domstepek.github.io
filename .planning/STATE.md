# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Someone should be able to land on the site and quickly understand what kinds of complex systems Dom builds, then explore the domains that matter to them without getting buried in noise.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Publishing Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Publishing Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Completed 01-02 accessible shell and metadata baseline

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 4.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |
| 2 | 0 | - | - |
| 3 | 0 | - | - |
| 4 | 0 | - | - |
| 5 | 0 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (6 min)
- Trend: Shared shell and accessibility baseline established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use a minimal landing page with deeper linked pages
- [Init]: Organize the site by domains/themes rather than a flat project gallery
- [Init]: Use a casual lowercase voice
- [Research]: Build as a static Astro site for GitHub Pages
- [Phase 01]: Default to the current GitHub Pages project-site shape while keeping site origin and base path overridable through PUBLIC_SITE_URL and PUBLIC_BASE_PATH. — This keeps the repository deploy-path-safe today while allowing a repo rename or custom domain later without rewriting routes.
- [Phase 01]: Create shared site metadata and URL helpers before layouts so later plans inherit one source of truth for canonical URLs, assets, and internal routes. — Centralizing the URL logic early removes the highest-risk Pages regression before page templates multiply.
- [Phase 01]: Keep the homepage intentionally minimal and use it as a smoke consumer of the new path helpers instead of pulling later-phase content forward. — This keeps plan 01 focused on infrastructure and avoids blurring the boundary with the homepage/content plans.
- [Phase 01]: Let BaseLayout own the shared metadata API and landmark structure so future pages only need page-level overrides. — This keeps head tags, canonicals, and semantic landmarks consistent as more routes are added.
- [Phase 01]: Ship the shell with readable typography, skip-link support, and visible focus styles before content-heavy phases. — This avoids treating accessibility and reading quality as cleanup work later.
- [Phase 01]: Route favicon and default OG assets through siteConfig plus shared path helpers. — This keeps metadata asset URLs valid under the GitHub Pages base path and avoids page-by-page drift.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Domain boundaries need to stay clear so projects do not get duplicated across pages.
- Flagship highlights need concrete proof, not generic platform language.
- GitHub Pages base-path behavior should be tested early.
